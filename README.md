# Express.js: Missing 'return' statement in error handling middleware

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: a missing `return` statement in error handling logic. This oversight can lead to unexpected behavior where multiple responses are sent, or error handling is bypassed.

## Bug Description
The bug involves missing `return` statements in error-handling logic within Express.js routes. When an error condition is met (e.g., a user isn't found), a response is sent to indicate the error. However, without the `return` statement, the code continues to execute, potentially sending another (inconsistent) response and causing unpredictable behavior. 

## Bug Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Make requests to routes `/users/:id` and `/users/:id/profile` with different IDs to observe the responses.

## Solution
The solution is to ensure that every error handling block includes a `return` statement to prevent further code execution within the route. This ensures a consistent response for error conditions.
